Project made by Diana Betancourt for [Udacity's](http://udacity.com) [Front End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011).
Code written by Diana Betancourt based on the starter code given for the project by Udacity.

## Description

In this project I made a landing page that includes a dynamic navigation bar. HTML. CSS and JavaScript were used.
The navigation bar is dynamically made by taking the information from the HTML file.

It also indicates where is the user on the page, by highlighting the active section as well as the active navigation button in the navbar
