Project made by Diana Betancourt for [Udacity's]
(#http://udacity.com)

[Front End Web Developer Nanodegree](#https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011).
Code written by Diana Betancourt based on starter code given for the project by Udacity.

## Description

In this project I made a navigation bar using JavaScript.
The navigation bar is dynamically made by taking the information from the HTML file.

It also indicates where is the user on the page, and highlights the active section as well as the active navigation button.
