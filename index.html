        <h2> What?</h2>
        <p>This landing page is a project created for Udacity's Front-End Web development Nanodegree. A landing page
           is a single web page that appears in response to clicking on a search engine, 
           marketing promotion, marketing email, or an online advertisement.In this case the page is dynamic.
          This landing page creates an interactive navigational experience for the user.</p>

    <section id="section2" data-nav="Dynamic?">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2> Dynamic?</h2>
          <p> Yes, the navigation bar you see is created "dynamically" based on the sections of the page. This sections 
            are in the HTML and if we add a new section it will automatically appear in the navbar.
            Learning how to do this can be particularly useful when we work with content management 
            systems or APIs and we are uncertain of where the items will be. 
            </p>

      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2> JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          This was done with JavaScript by using a ForEach loop that loops through every section present in the HTML 
          and for each section creates a list element. This list element is added to an empty navigation bar that was already
          defined as an unordered list element. Div elements are created and also appended to each list element
          so that we can add a link according to sections. This link is added listening to the click event and using 
          the scrollIntoView() function to scroll into the section of the navigation bar that we click. Additionally, 
          when a section is in the viewport a class called "active" is added which distinguishes the section in view and at 
          the same time highlights the section in the navigation bar.
